## Project Concept

### What are you building?

<!-- I am creating a portfolio webpage that can be used for other people as a template for their work. -->

### Who is it for?

<!-- This is focused mainly for students who are finishing their career and need to showcase their portfolio in a different way rather than in a regular PDF. With this web, they will be able to always have it online -->

### Why does it matter?

<!-- Nowadays, companies, design studios and personal customers are looking more and more for interactive media and competitivity is growing. That is why a web portfolio is a great way to prove your design skills and aesthetic taste. -->

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

<!-- I decided to go with a minimalistic but visual appealing aesthetic as it is a general portfolio for more than one person, that is why it needed to be general and not focus in just one style. Its minimalism also helps to make the works exposed stand out, as this is still a portfolio and needs to be functional. -->

### Color Palette

<!-- The colors mainly used for this project are mainly white, dark grey, dark brown and a specific tone of orange 

Orange: rgb(255, 174, 0)
Dark brown: rgb(78, 47, 0)
Grey: rgb(34, 34, 34) -->

### Typography

<!-- As the design tries to be minimalistic, the fonts have to accompany that style. -->

### Inspiration/References

<!-- List 2-3 websites or designs that inspire your approach -->
